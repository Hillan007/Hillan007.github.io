✨ Coding with Conviction: How Faith Shapes My Tech Journey
🛠️ The Code Behind the Calling
When I first started learning to code, it wasn’t just about building apps — it was about building impact. As a believer, I’ve always seen technology as a tool to serve, uplift, and connect. Whether I’m debugging a Flask app or designing church media, I’m reminded of 
#Colossians 3:23:
“Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters.”

This verse isn’t just a motto — it’s my workflow. It pushes me to write clean code, mentor others, and stay humble even when the deployment fails (again).

📖 Scripture as a Source of Strategy
Faith doesn’t just guide my ethics — it shapes my learning. When I hit a wall in a project, I turn to verses like:
- Proverbs 3:5–6 – “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding…”
This reminds me that growth isn’t always linear. Sometimes the detour teaches more than the destination.
- #James 1:5 – “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God…”
Whether I’m choosing a tech stack or navigating client expectations, I’ve learned to pray before I plan.

🌍 Building for More Than Myself
My projects — from Moodly to nonprofit sites — are rooted in purpose. I want my code to reflect compassion, clarity, and community. That’s why I care about:
- Privacy and ethics — because stewardship matters.
- Mentorship and accessibility — because tech should be inclusive.
- Church media and outreach — because creativity can be worship.
I believe that every line of code can be an act of service. And every bug fixed is a reminder that grace meets us in the mess.

🙌 When Tech Meets Testimony
I’ve seen God show up in unexpected ways — like when I couldn’t afford a tool but found a free workaround, or when a blog post I almost didn’t publish ended up encouraging someone else. These moments remind me that my journey isn’t just technical. It’s spiritual.
So whether I’m pushing to GitHub or pushing through doubt, I know I’m not coding alone.

💬 Final Thoughts
Faith doesn’t make me perfect — it makes me purposeful. And in a world of algorithms and APIs, I’m learning to listen to the still, small voice that says:
“Keep building. Keep believing. I’m with you.”
