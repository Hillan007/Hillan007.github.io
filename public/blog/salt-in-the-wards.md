# Salt in the Wards, Light in the Shadows

**Date:** 2025-09-08

Today, I walked into a hospital not as a patient, but as a messenger. Alongside my fellow believers from Murang’a University Christian Union, we stepped into a space heavy with pain, uncertainty, and quiet battles. Our mission was simple: to encourage. But what unfolded was far deeper.

As I stood in the wards, surrounded by patients whose bodies were weary but whose spirits still reached for hope, I felt a stirring. I was asked to speak—and to my surprise, I did. Not with trembling, but with a courage that had been quietly growing in me. It wasn’t just my voice that filled the room; it was the Word, the light, the salt.

In our Bible Study, we’ve often talked about being the salt of the earth and the light of the world. But today, I understood it differently. Salt doesn’t stay in the shaker. Light doesn’t hide under a bowl. We are called to go—to enter the places others avoid, to bring flavor to the bland, healing to the broken, and clarity to the confused.

> “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.” — Matthew 5:14

I saw faces soften. I saw tears held back. I saw God move—not through grand gestures, but through presence. Through a hand held, a prayer whispered, a word spoken with love.

Health is a gift. But so is the ability to serve while we’re healthy. Today reminded me that our strength isn’t just for us—it’s for others. And our faith isn’t meant to be stored—it’s meant to be shared.

To anyone reading this:  
Don’t wait for perfect conditions to shine.  
The world needs your light now.  
The hurting need your salt now.  
Step out. Speak up. Be present.
