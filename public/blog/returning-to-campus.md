# 🛤️ Returning to Campus: A Heart Full of Growth, A Spirit Ready to Lead

This holiday wasn’t just a break—it was a breakthrough.

As I prepare to return to school next week, I’m carrying more than just books and pens. I’m carrying the weight of a season that stretched me, shaped me, and reminded me why I do what I do.

I dove deep into coding—refining my backend skills, optimizing SEO, and building real-world solutions. One of the highlights was working with Sexual Purity, a client whose mission aligns with my values. I helped shape their backend infrastructure, and in doing so, I saw how tech can serve truth.

But it wasn’t just about code. I served in church media, designing stunning posters and live wallpapers that lit up our worship space. Even our pastor took notice—and that moment reminded me that creativity, when rooted in purpose, speaks louder than words.

Leaving this role behind is hard. There’s no one to fill the gap yet, and I feel the weight of that. But I trust that what I planted will grow, even in my absence.

Still, I won’t pretend I’m not anxious. School comes with its own battles—exams, CATs, group work, and the quiet ache of missed lunches when the budget runs thin. But I’m choosing faith over fear. I’m trusting that the God who sustained me through this season will walk with me into the next.

I’ve missed my friends. I’ve missed the weekend bike rides that felt like freedom. And I know that even in the grind, there will be grace.

So here’s to the next chapter. To showing up with excellence. To leading with love. To building with purpose.

> “I am confident of this: that He who began a good work in me will carry it on to completion.” — Philippians 1:6

Let’s go.
