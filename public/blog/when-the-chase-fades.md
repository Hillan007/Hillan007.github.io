# 📝 When the Chase Fades: A Quiet Revolution in Me

There was a time—not too long ago—when every girl I met felt like a spark. A possibility. A chase. I’d walk across campus and feel this magnetic pull, imagining what it’d be like to hold her hand, kiss her, call her mine. It wasn’t always about love—it was about the thrill. The fantasy. The validation.

But lately, something’s shifted.

I walk out of the library at 9pm, exhausted but fulfilled. I see couples holding hands, whispering sweet nothings, and instead of envy… I feel something else. Not bitterness. Not judgment. Just a quiet kind of sorry. Like I’m watching people chase something I no longer crave.

💭 What’s wrong with me?
That question haunted me for a while. Why don’t I feel the urge anymore? Why am I not interested in the chase?
But here’s the truth:
Nothing is wrong. I’m just evolving.

🧠 What I’ve realized:
- I’m growing emotionally. I crave depth, not dopamine. Connection, not conquest.
- My faith is shaping me. Lust doesn’t lead where I’m going. Purpose does.
- I’m focused. On tech. On impact. On becoming the man I’m called to be.
- I’m seeing through the noise. Not every hand-hold is love. Not every kiss is peace.

🔄 The shift isn’t loss—it’s clarity.
I’m not uninterested in women. I’m uninterested in performing. In pretending. In chasing shadows when I’m building substance.
I want a connection that aligns with my calling. A relationship that complements my growth, not distracts from it. And until then, I’m okay walking alone—because I’m not really alone. I’m walking with purpose.

🙏 To the guys still chasing:
I get it. I’ve been there. And maybe you’ll read this and think I’m just tired, or bitter, or overthinking. But maybe—just maybe—you’re feeling it too. That quiet tug toward something deeper. Toward becoming more than just a lover… but a leader.

🛤️ Where I’m headed:
I’m building. Coding. Mentoring. Worshiping. Dreaming of cockpits and cloudscapes. I’m not chasing girls—I’m chasing God’s vision for me.
And when love comes, it won’t be a chase.
It’ll be a homecoming.
