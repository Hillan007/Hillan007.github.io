# Building Moodly: From Idea to Launch

## Inspiration
Moodly was born from my passion for mental health and music. I wanted to create a tool that could help people track their moods and get personalized music recommendations to boost their well-being.

## The Idea
The core idea was simple: users log their mood, and Moodly suggests music and wellness tips tailored to their emotional state. I also wanted to use AI to make the recommendations smarter over time.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Flask, Python
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow, OpenAI API
- **Music API:** Spotify
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Development Journey
1. **Prototyping:** I started with wireframes in Figma and mapped out the user journey.
2. **Building the Backend:** Flask handled user data, authentication, and AI integration. I trained a simple mood classifier using TensorFlow.
3. **Frontend:** React made it easy to build a responsive UI. Tailwind CSS helped with fast styling.
4. **Integrating Spotify:** I used the Spotify API to fetch music recommendations based on mood.
5. **AI Integration:** The AI model improved recommendations by learning from user feedback.

## Challenges
- Integrating multiple APIs (Spotify, OpenAI) and handling authentication.
- Ensuring user privacy and data security.
- Making the AI recommendations feel personal and accurate.

## Launch & Impact
Moodly launched in 2025 and quickly gained traction among students and young professionals. Users reported feeling more in control of their moods and discovering new music they loved.

## Lessons Learned
- Start simple, then iterate based on feedback.
- User privacy is criticalâ€”always prioritize it.
- AI can enhance user experience, but human-centered design is key.
