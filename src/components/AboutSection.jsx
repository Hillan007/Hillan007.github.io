      ✈️ <strong>From Skies to Code: A Journey of Purpose</strong><br /><br />
      I’m Victor Hillan—most people call me Champ. My first dream was flying, and that vision of soaring above the clouds still inspires me.<br /><br />
      But along the way, I discovered another passion: software engineering.<br /><br />
      What began as curiosity became a calling. I’ve built apps like Moodly, optimized SEO for nonprofits, and designed media that moves hearts.<br /><br />
      In 2026, I’m expanding into AI-powered solutions and scalable web platforms, blending creativity, faith, and technology to reach people across borders.<br /><br />
      Software engineering didn’t replace my dream of flying—it expanded it. Now I pilot ideas, communities, and innovation—one keystroke at a time.
