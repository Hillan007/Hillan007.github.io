      ✈️ <strong>From Skies to Code: My Journey of Passion and Purpose</strong><br /><br />
      I’m Victor Hillan—most people call me Champ. Before I ever wrote a line of code, I dreamed of flying. Becoming a pilot was my first love—the idea of soaring above the clouds, navigating vast skies, and seeing the world from a higher perspective. That dream still lives in me. I haven’t given up on it.<br /><br />
      But somewhere along the way, another passion found me.<br /><br />
      I stumbled into software engineering with curiosity and a bit of hesitation. What started as a side interest quickly became a calling. I taught myself Flask, React, and the art of building things that work—and more importantly, things that matter.<br /><br />
      Now I build apps like Moodly, remix worship lyrics for youth outreach, and design church media that moves hearts. I’ve optimized SEO for nonprofits, mentored teammates, and led online communities with purpose. I’ve debugged code at midnight and deployed faith-driven projects at dawn.<br /><br />
      Software engineering didn’t replace my dream of flying—it expanded it. Now I fly in different ways: through creativity, through impact, through lines of code that reach people across borders.<br /><br />
      <em>“I still dream of cockpits. But for now, I pilot ideas, faith, and innovation—one keystroke at a time.”</em><br /><br />
      This portfolio isn’t just a showcase. It’s a testimony. Of how passion evolves. Of how purpose finds you. Of how you can chase the sky and still build the future.
