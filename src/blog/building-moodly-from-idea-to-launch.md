# Building Moodly: From Idea to Launch

Every project starts with a spark. For me, Moodly was born from a love of music and a desire to help people find songs that match their feelings.

## The Inspiration
I noticed friends struggling to find music that fit their mood. What if an app could recommend songs based on how you feel?

## Tech Stack Choices
- **Frontend:** React for a fast, interactive UI
- **Backend:** Flask for flexibility and Python’s ecosystem
- **APIs:** Music recommendation APIs, OpenAI for mood analysis

## Challenges Faced
- Integrating multiple APIs
- Handling user input and privacy
- Designing a simple, joyful interface

## Lessons Learned
- Start with MVP, then iterate
- User feedback is gold
- Don’t be afraid to pivot

## Launch & Impact
Moodly launched at [moodly-2-0.vercel.app](https://moodly-2-0.vercel.app/). Users loved the personalized recommendations and clean design. It’s a project I’m proud of!

## What’s Next?
- Add more music sources
- Improve mood detection
- Open source parts of the project
